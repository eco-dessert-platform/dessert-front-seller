# Dynamic Routing Structure

- Dynamic routing is implemented in the `src/pages/url/` folder using `[param]` syntax
- Example: `/url/[aid]/Sample.tsx` → `/url/123/Sample`
- **File Naming Rule**: To distinguish from features, it is recommended (not required) to use the `Page` suffix for page components
